Map List:
Include the level name, author, and what weapons the level will give the player. Put an asterisk by the weapon to denote that it's a secret item.
Feel free to include requests for earlier and later maps in the episode, such as if you want your level to have the first appearance of a weapon.
If you don't know where the level will fit into the episode yet, put it in the "Unsorted Singleplayer Levels" section.
See the bottom for the guidelines we have set for how the campaign will work.
